<h3 align="center">A Tetris homage that tests your RegEx skills!</h3>

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] 

RegExtris takes the classic game of tetris and makes it into a learning and practicing environment for regular expressions. Learning to use regular expressions can be a daunting task and often programmers tend to leave it in the "I'll just google it when I need it" but having a basic understanding of the power of regex can take that google search to a much complex place. If you're comfortable with regex already, you can dive in and play or if you need a bit more guidance then you can use the learn mode to get your bearings first.
